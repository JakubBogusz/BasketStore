# BasketStore
This is a basketball e-commerce website prototype. Basicaly users can register/ authorize on the site and do shopping, filter products, add them to the cart, track previous ordes and much more. Web Api was desgined with .Net Core 5.0 and frontend with Angular v13 with Typescript. As a database I'm using Sqlite and also Redis when it comes to handling the customer shopping cart. The project is still under development - I update it in my free time. 

In the project files I also attached file ZTI_Basketstore with short summary (for now in polish) of the application features.
